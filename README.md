Theme: Summer Olympics

Question 1:⁠ ⁠Do host countries win more medals at the Olympic games than other countries? This study examines whether hosting the Olympics gives countries an advantage in winning medals. By comparing the medal counts of host countries with the global average for the same events, we’ll consider factors like investment in sports infrastructure, larger delegations, and home crowd support. Relevant datasets include historical Olympic medal data, host country records, and athlete statistics. The analysis will explore whether the "home advantage" is consistent across different events or sports.

Question 2:⁠ ⁠How does population size affect a country's success in the Summer Olympics? This study explores whether larger populations lead to more Olympic medals or if factors like economic resources and sports policies are more important. By analyzing population data and Olympic medal counts, we’ll look for correlations and compare countries with similar populations but different levels of success. The goal is to determine whether population size is a key predictor of Olympic performance or just one of many influencing factors.

Question 3: What impact do the Olympics have on environmental sustainability of cities? The Olympics are a global event that can have both positive and negative effects on the environment. This question looks at how hosting the Olympics impacts sustainability, including areas like energy use, waste, and pollution. By studying data from past Olympic Games, we can see if efforts like using renewable energy or building eco-friendly stadiums have helped reduce the environmental impact. We’ll also explore if hosting the Olympics creates long-term benefits for the environment or causes more harm through increased resource use and construction.
