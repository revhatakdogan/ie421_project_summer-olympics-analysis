Theme: Summer Olympics

The 2024 Paris Olympics were exciting for everyone. The number of medals won showed significant variation; some countries won no medals at all, while countries like the United States won dozens. So, is there a connection between these variations in medal counts?

Countries' levels of development are measured by many different parameters. The Human Development Index (HDI) is a measure of a country's human development. A higher HDI score usually indicates longer life expectancy, better education levels, and higher Gross National Income (GNI) per capita. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is a monetary measure of the market value of all final goods and services produced by a country within a specific period of time. The Gini coefficient measures income inequality within a population.

Developed countries tend to outperform developing and underdeveloped nations in many areas, including art, technology, health, and sports.

So, did the level of development in countries help them win medals at the Paris 2024 Summer Olympics? We will investigate this through HDI, Gini Coefficient, and GDP.
